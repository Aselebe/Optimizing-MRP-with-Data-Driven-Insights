Project Overview
In the retail industry, effective pricing is essential for driving sales and maximising revenue. This project employs machine learning techniques to predict Maximum Retail Price (MRP) based on a variety of product and outlet characteristics, creating a foundation for data-driven pricing strategies. By understanding how factors such as product visibility, type, outlet characteristics, and location affect MRP, retail managers and pricing analysts can make informed decisions that align with both customer preferences and revenue objectives.
